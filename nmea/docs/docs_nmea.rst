***********
NMEA Module
***********

This module implements a Zerynth driver and parser for a generic NMEA GNSS receiver.


The following functionalities are implemented:

    * retrieve the current location fix if present
    * retrieve the current UTC time

The driver supports reading NMEA sentences from a serial port only.

Location fixes are obtained by parsing NMEA sentences of type RMC and GGA, and optionally GSA.
Obtaining a fix or UTC time are thread safe operations.

    
.. method:: readline(serial,buffer,timeout=5000)

    Wait for a full NMEA sentence from the specified *serial* interface and copy it
    to the specified *buffer* (bytearray), with optional *timeout* (in milliseconds).

    Returns the length of the NMEA sentence or a negative error code:

    * *-1*, if the line does not start with NMEA header (missing :samp:`'$'`)
    * *-2*, if the line has incomplete NMEA sentence (missing  :samp:`'*'`)
    * *-3*, if the line has invalid or mismatching NMEA checksum

    
.. method:: parseline(buffer,length,tm,fix)

    Parse the content of the specified line *buffer* (bytearray) up to *length* bytes
    and fill the two sequences *tm* and *fix* with date/time and fix data if available.

    Returned value is *0* if the line does not have valid data, or a combination (sum) of:
    
    * *4*, if the *tm* sequence (7 items) has been filled (from RMC sentence)
    * *1, 2 or 3*, if the *fix* sequence (9 items) has been filled (from RMC, GGA or GSA respectively)

    
.. class:: NMEA_Receiver()

    This class is meant to be used as a base class to provide a uniform interface for GNSS receivers.

    Instances of this class are fed with NMEA sentences using the :any:`parse` method and can be
    queried for UTC time and location data.

    
.. method:: fix()

        Return the current fix or None if no fix is available.
        A fix is a tuple with the following elements:

            * latitude in decimal format (-89.9999 - 89.9999)
            * longitude in decimal format (-179.9999 - 179.9999)
            * altitude in meters
            * speed in Km/h
            * course over ground as degrees from true north
            * number of satellites for this fix
            * horizontal dilution of precision (0.5 - 99.9)
            * vertical dilution of precision (0.5 - 99.9)
            * positional dilution of precision (0.5 - 99.9)
            * UTC time as a tuple (yyyy,MM,dd,hh,mm,ss,microseconds)

        
.. method:: has_fix()
    
        Return *True* if a fix is available

        
.. method:: utc()

        Return the current UTC time or None if no UTC time is available.
        A UTC time is a tuple of (yyyy,MM,dd,hh,mm,ss,microseconds).

        UTC time can be wrong if no fix has ever been obtained.
        
.. method:: has_utc()
    
        Return *True* if a UTC time is available

        
.. method:: parse(buffer,count)
    
        Parse *count* bytes from the specified *buffer* (bytearray) and updates internal state
        from valid NMEA sentences found.
